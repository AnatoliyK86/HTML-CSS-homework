                <p>
                    Marvel Comics is the brand name and primary imprint of Marvel Worldwide Inc., formerly Marvel Publishing, Inc. and
                    Marvel Comics Group, a publisher of American comic books and related media. In 2009, The Walt Disney Company acquired
                    Marvel Entertainment, Marvel Worldwide's parent company.
                    
                    Marvel started in 1939 as Timely Publications, and by the early 1950s, had generally become known as Atlas Comics. The
                    Marvel branding began in 1961, the year that the company launched The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created
                    by Steve Ditko, Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and many others.

                    operate in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe, with most locations mirroring real-life places; many major
                    characters are based in New York City.
